every user can create a maintanence request.


I want my front end has two user: regular, admin

admin functionality:
    ----------------------------------------
    -> Add maintanence_team like Electricians, It Support etc.
    -> below shows created teams
    ----------------------------------------
    -> Add team member to it. and also team manager tick while adding team member.
        > there is always one team manger in the maintanence_team.
    (while adding team member the admin has dropdwon list of the employees)
    -> below shows team and team member mapping table and its role
    ----------------------------------------
    -> Add Equpiment category:
        name: name of category like Computer, software, servers
        team_id: this represtens the team which is maintain this category.
        technician_id: id of technician.
    (while adding Equpiment category the admin has dropdwon list of the maintanence_teams)
    (the default technician is the technician_id but admin can change to any one)
    -> Below show the added Equpment category.
    ----------------------------------------
